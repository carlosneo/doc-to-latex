This project it`s a complier written with Flex and Bison. The compiler it`s to convert a .odt file to a .tex file. The template used was form SBC (Sociedade Brasileira de Computação). So the entire compiler was build to work with those files, it isn`t a universal code. Inside the project the folde call Docs, has all template files that was used. To build it, firt of all it was made a convertion from .odt to xml file, and them our compiler reads those xml and generate the code in .tex.
